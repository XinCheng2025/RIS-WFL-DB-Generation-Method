Abstract of the paper: 

Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising technology to enhance indoor wireless communication and sensing performance. However, the construction of reliable received signal strength (RSS)-based fingerprint databases for RIS-assisted indoor positioning remains an open challenge due to the lack of realistic and spatially consistent channel modeling methods. In this paper, we propose a novel method with open-source codes for generating RIS-assisted RSS fingerprint databases. Our method captures the complex RIS-assisted multipath behaviors by extended cluster-based channel modeling and the physical and electromagnetic properties of RIS and transmitter (Tx). And the spatial consistency is incorporated when simulating the fingerprint data collection across neighboring positions. Furthermoreï¼Œ the proposed method offers exceptional flexibility in configuring RIS and Tx parameters. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the fingerprint database generated by the proposed method. Moreover, the positioning performance on the database using K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and deep neural network (DNN) is analyzed, providing valuable insights for the system design.
